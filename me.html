<h3>me</h3>

<p>hihi welcome to my website :) My name is technically <b>Narawutti Wongwandanee</b> but for everyone's ease I go by <b>Brahm.</b></p>

<p>I was born in Bangkok, Thailand and I moved to Calgary, Canada, which is where I grew up with my parents and my older brother.
    Right now I'm studying in a combined major for Microbiology and Computer Science at the University of British Columbia!!
</p>

<p>This site is just a fun personal project for me coded with HTML and CSS using jekyll and my own theme! I love
    drawing, rhythm games, gunpla and going to the gym :> I also watch anime sometimes. Maybe when im rich i want to travel more.
</p>
